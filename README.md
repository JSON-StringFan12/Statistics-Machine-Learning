# Statistics-Machine-Learning-Test
 A simple neural network designed to predict the grade of a student based on my high school's student data (in an excel spreadsheet).
 
 The NN has 5 inputs that can be entered from the run tab:
    The hypothetical student's learning type (online or in-person).
   
    Whether or not the hypothetical student is new to the school.
   
    The gender of the hypothetical student (only M or F).
   
    The city the hypothetical student resides in.
   
    The zip code the hypothetical student resides in.
   

From my testing, the neural network has about a 50% accuracy. This is relatively good considering the size of the training data is small.

This is my first project with machine learning, and it definitely won't be my last.
